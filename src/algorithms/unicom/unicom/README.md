For image representation:
1. ImageNet pretraining is not universal enough to generalize to diverse open-world objects.
2. Supervised learning is not scalable because manual annotation of large-scale training data is time-consuming, costly, and even infeasible.
3. Instance discrimination method (e.g., CLIP) can hardly encode the semantic structure of training data, because instance-wise contrastive learning always treats two samples as a negative pair, regardless of their semantic similarity.

UNICOM demonstrates superior performance in image retrieval, thanks to its ability to cluster **400000000** images into **1000000** pseudo classes using joint textual and visual features extracted by the CLIP model. Additionally, our use of a margin-based softmax loss (ArcFace) and random partial class/feature (PartialFC) selections enhances the robustness and compactness of the feature embedding. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised image retrieval approaches, making it a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners in the field.

The model unicom was pre-trained on [laion400M](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset/), and in the future, we will release the model trained on laion2B.


## Usage
First, install PyTorch 1.12 (or later) and torchvision, as well as small additional dependencies, and then install this repo as a Python package.
On a CUDA GPU machine, the following will do the trick:

```shell
pip install torch torchvision
pip install tqdm timm
pip install git+https://github.com/deepglint/unicom.git
```

### API

The unicom module provides the following methods:

#### `unicom.available_models()`

Returns the names of the available unicom models.

#### `unicom.load(name)`

Returns the model and the TorchVision transform needed by the model, specified by the model name returned by `unicom.available_models()`. It will download the model as necessary.
