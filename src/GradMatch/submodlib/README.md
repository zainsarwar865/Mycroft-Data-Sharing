# Setup

## Alternative 1
* `$ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ submodlib`

## Alternative 2 (if local docs need to be built and test cases need to be run)
* `$ git clone https://github.com/decile-team/submodlib.git`
* `$ cd submodlib`
* `$ pip install .`
* **Latest documentation** is available at [readthedocs](https://submodlib.readthedocs.io/). However, if local documentation is required to be built, follow these steps::
    * `$ pip install -U sphinx`
    * `$ pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex`
    * `$ pip install sphinx-rtd-theme`
    * `$ cd docs`
    * `$ make clean html`
* **To run the tests**, follow these steps:
    * `$ pip install pytest`
    * `$ pytest` # this runs ALL tests
    * `$ pytest -m <marker> --verbose --disable-warnings -rA` # this runs test specified by the <marker>. Possible markers are mentioned in pyproject.toml file.

# Usage

It is very easy to get started with submodlib. Using a submodular function in submodlib essentially boils down to just two steps:

1. instantiate the corresponding function object
2. invoke the desired method on the created object

The most frequently used methods are:
1. f.evaluate() - takes a subset and returns the score of the subset as computed by the function f
2. f.marginalGain() - takes a subset and an element and returns the marginal gain of adding the element to the subset, as computed by f
3. f.maximize() - takes a budget and an optimizer to return an optimal set as a result of maximizing f

For example,
```
from submodlib import FacilityLocationFunction
objFL = FacilityLocationFunction(n=43, data=groundData, mode="dense", metric="euclidean")
greedyList = objFL.maximize(budget=10,optimizer='NaiveGreedy')
```

# Timing Analysis

To gauge the performance of submodlib, selection by Facility Location was performed on a randomly generated dataset of 1024-dimensional points. Specifically the following code was run for the number of data points ranging from 50 to 10000.

```
K_dense = helper.create_kernel(dataArray, mode="dense", metric='euclidean', method="other")
obj = FacilityLocationFunction(n=num_samples, mode="dense", sijs=K_dense, separate_rep=False,pybind_mode="array")
obj.maximize(budget=budget,optimizer=optimizer, stopIfZeroGain=False, stopIfNegativeGain=False, verbose=False, show_progress=False)
```

The above code was timed using Python's timeit module averaged across three executions each. We report the following numbers:

| Number of data points      | Time taken (in seconds) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 50 | 0.00043|
| 100  |	0.001074|
| 200  |	0.003024|
| 500  |	0.016555|
| 1000  |	0.081773|
| 5000	| 2.469303|
| 6000	| 3.563144|
| 7000	| 4.667065|
| 8000	| 6.174047|
| 9000	| 8.010674|
| 10000	| 9.417298|
